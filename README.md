Interface to find synonyms using the offline database of thesaurus.

Originally a fork of [https://github.com/rohithkn/synonyms-array](https://github.com/rohithkn/synonyms-array), but due to a lack
of response from the author I created my own using [zaibacu/thesaurus](https://github.com/zaibacu/thesaurus).

## ⬇️ Installation

`npm i js-synonyms`

## 📋 Usage

- `synonym`: Retrieves the synonym of the given word
- `search`: Searches in the library for all the words matching the substring
